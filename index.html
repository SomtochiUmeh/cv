        <p>
          I am a Computer Science major at Minerva University interested in anything
          computer programming. I am skilled in Python programming and quite interested
          in Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I have also dabbled in iOS
          mobile app development where I built a simple flashcards application. I'm
          currently learning some web development as I have picked up interest in
          blockchain technologies and how it can redefine the current structure of the
          world. I am also curious about what web3 would mean for advancements in
          Artificial Intelligence since everyone owns their own data, or is the world
          already inundated with enough data for machine learning applications?
